Buildr is part of Linear’s decentralised application suite. Users can stake LINA tokens to build ℓUSD, the base currency of Linear Exchange. Stakers are entitled to staking rewards and a split of the transaction fees generated by Linear Exchange. Users can then use ℓUSD minted to purchase synthetic assets on Linear Exchange to gain different investment exposures. ℓUSD can also be moved to other protocols or dApps within the DeFi ecosystem. As such, Buildr will involve three separate functions in this case, Build, Burn, and Claim
